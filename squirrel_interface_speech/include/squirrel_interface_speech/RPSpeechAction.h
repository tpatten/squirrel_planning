/**
 * This file defines the RPSpeechAction class.
 * RPSpeechAction is used by SQUIRREL to interpret speech.
 * PDDL "observe-has_spoken" observations actions check the knowledge base to see if 
 * a command has been spoken. We currently only care about the commands:
 * "gehe" - which is a command for Kenny to observe the dinosaur.
 * "links" - notifies Kenny that it is the next child's turn.
